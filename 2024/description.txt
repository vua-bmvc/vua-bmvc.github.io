Video understanding is a popular field in computer vision and AI where we aim to learn/assess the world
around us from video footage and can benefit many real-world applications, such as training and education,
patient monitoring, sports assessment, and security systems. By automating these applications through
video analysing, not only we can save money and time for their users, but also, we can decrease human
errors. Despite the recent advances in the other areas of computer vision, e.g. image analysis, video
understanding is still an unsolved problem and is considered a very challenging task.
The proposed workshop on video understanding aims to address the challenges in this field by making the
following contributions:
• Bringing together leading experts in the field of video understanding to help propel the field forward.
This includes junior and senior researchers, with equal representation and contribution from academia
and industry
• The workshop also aims to stimulate and accelerate research progress in the field of video under-
standing to match the requirements of real-world applications by identifying the challenges and ways
to address them through a panel discussion between experts, presenters and attendees
